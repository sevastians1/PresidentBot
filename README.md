#A Personal Discord Bot Project


I built a discord bot in an evening which pulls text from a user input or prompt in discord, and calls to chatGPT API, 
responding in a specific funny way, and pushing that new generated text to eleven labs.
Eleven labs would respond back with a voice emulator that I previously fed soundbytes to, specifically
soundbytes of recent presidents. Elevenlabs would send an MP3 file that I would have broadcasted to the 
discord chat.

This project represents my capablity to pursue creativity with my code.
